# The QuickHull package

QuickHull is a na√Øve implementation of the
[QuickHull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quickhull) algorithm for calculating
the convex hull of a set of points in 2D.

## Usage

The algorithm works with `Vec{2}`s from
[FixedSizeArrays](https://github.com/SimonDanisch/FixedSizeArrays.jl), so you
can pass a vector of such points directly to the algorithm:

```@example
using FixedSizeArrays
points = map(Vec, rand(25), rand(25))

using QuickHull
hull = qhull(points)
```

The points are returned in order, starting with the leftmost point and moving
counter-clockwise around convex hull.

You can also just pass two arrays of equal length containing the ``x``
and ``y`` values of your points, and `qhull` will figure it out:

```@example
xs, ys = rand(25), rand(25)

using QuickHull
xhull, yhull = qhull(xs, ys)
```

As you notice, the format of the return values matches that of the input.
